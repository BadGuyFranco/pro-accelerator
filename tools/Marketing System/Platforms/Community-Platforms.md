# Community Platforms: Hosted Spaces for Connection

**Core Insight:** Community platforms (Discord, Slack, Circle, Skool, etc.) are fundamentally different from social media. They're owned spaces where you control the environment and members choose to invest attention. The platform is the container; the culture is what matters.


## Objective

To provide principle-based guidance for selecting, setting up, and managing community platforms that facilitate member connection and drive business results.

## 1. Platform Psychology: Why People Join Communities

### The Mindset
- **Belonging:** Feeling part of a tribe
- **Access:** Connection to leader and members
- **Learning:** Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing
- **Support:** Help with specific challenges
- **Status:** Recognition within a valued group

### What This Means for Operators
- The platform is secondary to the culture
- Member-to-member value is the goal
- Your role shifts from creator to facilitator
- Community health requires active cultivation

## 2. Platform Selection Principles

### Key Questions
1. **Where is your audience already?** (Reduce friction)
2. **What interaction model do you need?** (Real-time vs. async)
3. **What features are essential?** (Courses, events, DMs, threads)
4. **What's your ownership model?** (Data export, control)
5. **What's your scale trajectory?** (Will it grow with you?)

### Platform Categories

| Category | Examples | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Chat-First** | Discord, Slack | Real-time engagement, younger audiences |
| **Forum-First** | Circle, Discourse | Organized discussions, searchable |
| **Hybrid/All-in-One** | Skool, Mighty Networks | Course + community integrated |
| **Social-Based** | Facebook Groups | Easy adoption, familiar UX |

### Trade-offs

| Factor | Chat-First | Forum-First |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Speed of interaction | Fast | Slower |
| Searchability | Poor | Good |
| FOMO potential | High | Low |
| Overwhelm risk | High | Lower |
| Async-friendly | No | Yes |

## 3. Community Structure

### Channel/Space Architecture
**Principle:** Start minimal; add as needed. Too many channels fragments conversation.

**Essential Spaces:**
- Welcome/introductions
- Main discussion
- Wins/celebrations
- Questions/help
- Resources/announcements

**Optional (Add as Needed):**
- Topic-specific channels
- Regional/timezone groups
- Role-based spaces (beginners vs. advanced)
- Off-topic/casual

### Access Tiers
| Tier | Access | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Free | Limited channels | Lead generation, community taste |
| Paid Basic | Full community | Core membership value |
| Premium | Exclusive spaces | High-touch, advanced members |

---

## 4. Community Operations

### Daily Rhythms
- Greet new members personally (or automated welcome + manual follow-up)
- Seed discussion if conversation is slow
- Highlight wins and contributions
- Answer questions or facilitate answers

### Weekly Rhythms
- Live event (office hours, Q&A, workshop)
- Recap or digest (for async members)
- Featured member or win spotlight
- Content drop or resource share

### Monthly Rhythms
- Community feedback/pulse check
- Major event or challenge
- Recognition of top contributors
- Review metrics and health

## 5. Engagement Facilitation

### Starting Conversations
Don't wait for members to talk. Seed engagement:
- **Prompts:** "What's your biggest challenge with [X]?"
- **Polls:** Quick engagement, signals preferences
- **Challenges:** Time-bound activities with outcomes
- **Hot Seats:** Focused feedback on one member's situation

### Facilitating vs. Dominating
- Ask questions more than give answers
- Highlight member expertise
- Connect members to each other
- Your role: host, not sole performer

### Encouraging Contribution
- Recognize contributors publicly
- Create roles or badges for active members
- Ask engaged members to help others
- Lower the bar for participation (emojis count)

---

## 6. Moderation Principles

### Setting Expectations
- Clear community guidelines (visible and enforced)
- Code of conduct for interactions
- What happens when rules are broken

### Enforcement Approach
- Address issues promptly
- Private message first; public action if repeated
- Consistency is key; rules apply to everyone
- Remove bad actors quickly (one toxic member destroys culture)

### Common Issues
- Spam and self-promotion
- Off-topic derailing
- Conflict between members
- Inactive members (not a moderation issue)

---

## 7. Trust Signals in Communities

### What Builds Credibility
- **Your Presence:** Active, engaged, accessible
- **Member Success:** Visible wins and results
- **Quality of Interaction:** Helpful, supportive culture
- **Organization:** Easy to navigate, find value
- **Consistency:** Regular rhythms, reliable events

### What Destroys Trust
- Ghost leadership (founder disappears)
- Promised events that don't happen
- Unanswered questions
- Toxic members allowed to persist
- All promotion, no value

## 8. Conversion Paths: Community to Revenue

### Free Community as Funnel
```
Free Community → Engagement → Trust Built → Ready for Paid Offer
                                                    ↓
              Paid Product/Membership → Customer Community
```

### Paid Community as Product
The community itself is the value:
- Access to you and other members
- Exclusive content and resources
- Events and live interaction
- Accountability and support

### Upsell Paths
- Free → Paid membership
- Paid → Premium tier
- Community → Additional products (courses, coaching)
- Community → Services or high-ticket

## 9. Measurement Framework

### Health Metrics
- **DAU/MAU Ratio:** Daily active / Monthly active (stickiness)
- **Posts per Day:** Activity level
- **New Member Retention:** Still active after 7/30/90 days
- **Member-Generated Content:** Ratio of member to admin posts

### Business Metrics
- Revenue from community (if paid)
- Conversion rate from free to paid
- Churn rate (members leaving)
- CLV of community members vs. non-community customers
- Support deflection (questions answered in community)

### Qualitative Signals
- Quality of discussions
- Member testimonials and feedback
- Spontaneous member-to-member help
- Organic referrals

1. **Platform Obsession:** Focusing on tools over culture
2. **Over-Structuring:** Too many channels, too many rules
3. **Under-Facilitating:** Expecting community to run itself
4. **Ghost Launching:** Launch with no activity seeded
5. **Broadcasting Mode:** Treating it like a newsletter
6. **Ignoring Bad Actors:** One toxic member ruins the space
