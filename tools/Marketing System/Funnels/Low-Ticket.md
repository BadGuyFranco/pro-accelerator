# Low-Ticket Funnels: Buyers, Not Just Leads

**Core Insight:** A low-ticket funnel converts leads into buyers. The first purchase, no matter how small, is the most important conversion. Once someone pays, they're 10x more likely to pay again. The goal is acquiring customers, not maximizing front-end revenue.


## Objective

To provide a framework for building low-ticket funnels that create buyers, fund acquisition costs, and set up backend ascension.

## 1. Low-Ticket Strategy

### The Real Goal
- **Create buyers:** The psychological shift from "lead" to "customer"
- **Fund acquisition:** Break even or profit to offset ad costs
- **Identify serious prospects:** Buyers are more likely to buy again
- **Seed ascension:** First step on the value ladder

### Typical Price Points
- Threshold offers: $7-$47
- Low-ticket courses/products: $47-$197
- Free + Shipping: $0 + $7-$15 shipping

## 2. Low-Ticket Funnel Types

### Author Pipeline (Free + Shipping)
**Best For:** Establishing authority quickly with a physical product

**Structure:**
```
Landing Page → Order Form → Tier-Up 1 → Tier-Up 2 → Thank You → Backend Emails
```

**Key Elements:**
- Physical book (or digital + physical)
- Customer pays shipping only ($7-$15)
- Immediate tier-ups increase order value
- Book content pre-frames core offer

### Threshold Offer Funnel
**Best For:** Converting cold traffic into buyers

**Structure:**
```
Sales Page → Order Form → Tier-Up 1 → Tier-Up 2 → Thank You → Onboarding
```

**Key Elements:**
- Low-price digital product ($7-$47)
- Solves specific, urgent problem
- Quick win increases trust
- Naturally leads to core offer

### Break-Even Gateway
**Best For:** Funding ad spend to acquire leads at zero cost

**Structure:**
```
Opt-In → Lead Magnet → Low-Ticket Offer → Tier-Ups → Thank You
```

**Key Elements:**
- Lead magnet captures email first
- Immediate low-ticket offer on thank you page
- Goal: front-end revenue = ad cost
- Profit comes from backend

## 3. Core Funnel Structure

### Page 1: Sales Page or Landing Page
**For Threshold/Author Pipeline:**
- Headline: Specific benefit, concrete outcome
- Problem/empathy section
- Solution introduction
- Offer description (what they get)
- Price with value anchor
- Guarantee
- CTA to order form

**For Break-Even Gateway:**
- Opt-in page first (lead capture)
- Low-ticket offer on thank you page

### Page 2: Order Form
- Simple, clean design
- Minimal required fields
- Order summary visible
- Payment options clear
- Order bump offer (checkbox upsell)

### Page 3-4: Tier-Up Pages (OTO)
One-time offers presented after purchase:

**Tier-Up 1:** Complement or accelerate
- "Add this to get results faster"
- Usually 2-3x the front-end price

**Tier-Up 2:** Different angle or next step
- "Here's what to do next..."
- Can be higher or similar price

**Tier-Down (Downsell):**
- If they decline tier-up, offer smaller version
- Payment plan option
- Lower-commitment alternative

### Page 5: Thank You / Access Page
- Confirm purchase
- Deliver product or access
- Set expectations
- Invite to community or next step

---

## 4. Order Bumps

An order bump is a checkbox offer on the order form itself.

### Characteristics
- Shown on checkout page before payment
- Simple checkbox to add
- Complements main offer
- Low friction, impulse add-on
- Typically $19-$47

### Order Bump Ideas
- Templates or swipe files
- Additional training
- Workbook or implementation guide
- Done-for-you elements
- Fast-action bonus

### Performance
- Good order bump adds 20-40% to AOV
- Must be genuinely valuable and relevant

---

## 5. Tier-Up Strategy

### Tier-Up Principles
- Present immediately after purchase (highest buying temperature)
- One offer per page (don't overwhelm)
- Clear benefit statement
- Urgency: "This offer won't be shown again"
- Easy yes/no choice

### Tier-Up Sequence Logic
| Position | Offer Type | Price Range |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Bump | Complement | $19-$47 |
| Tier-Up 1 | Accelerate/Expand | $47-$197 |
| Tier-Up 2 | Next step/Different angle | $97-$297 |
| Tier-Down | Smaller version if declined | 50-70% of tier-up |

### Tier-Up Copy Structure
1. Congratulate on purchase
2. "Before you access, I have something important..."
3. What it is and why it helps
4. Why it's exclusive to this moment
5. Price and CTA
6. "No thanks" link (must be visible)

---

## 6. Pricing and Economics

### The Math
```
Goal: CPA (Cost to Acquire Customer) ≤ AOV (Average Order Value)
```

**Example:**
- Front-end product: $27
- Order bump (30% take rate): $37 × 0.3 = $11.10
- Tier-up 1 (20% take rate): $97 × 0.2 = $19.40
- Tier-up 2 (10% take rate): $197 × 0.1 = $19.70
- **Total AOV: $27 + $11.10 + $19.40 + $19.70 = $77.20**

If CPA is $50, you're acquiring customers profitably. If CPA is $77, you're breaking even (free customers).

### Levers to Improve
- Increase front-end conversion rate
- Increase order bump take rate
- Increase tier-up conversion rates
- Test different tier-up offers and prices

---

## 7. Post-Purchase Flow

### Immediate
- Deliver product/access
- Welcome email with next steps
- Set expectations for future communication

### Short-Term (Days 1-7)
- Onboarding sequence specific to buyers
- Consumption prompts (help them use what they bought)
- Testimonial request (after initial win)

### Medium-Term
- Transition to core offer pitch
- Continue nurture cadence
- Ascension path to mid/high-ticket

---

## 8. Measurement Framework

### Funnel Metrics
- **Conversion Rate:** Visitors to buyers
- **AOV:** Average order value (including bumps and tier-ups)
- **CPA:** Cost per acquisition
- **EPC:** Earnings per click

### Tier-Up Metrics
- Order bump take rate
- Tier-up 1 conversion rate
- Tier-up 2 conversion rate
- Tier-down conversion rate (if offered)

### Business Metrics
- Front-end profitability (or break-even status)
- Backend conversion rate (buyers to core offer)
- CLV of low-ticket buyers
