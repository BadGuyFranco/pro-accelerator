# Continuity Funnels: Recurring Revenue

**Core Insight:** Continuity (memberships, subscriptions) creates predictable revenue and stabilizes business. The funnel's job is to acquire members and reduce churn. Retention is as important as acquisition; every month they stay multiplies your initial investment.


## Objective

To provide a framework for building continuity funnels that acquire subscribers, deliver ongoing value, and maximize retention.

## 1. Continuity Models

### Membership Site
- Access to content library
- Community component
- Regular new content
- Often includes live elements (calls, events)

### Subscription Service
- Recurring delivery of product or service
- Predictable fulfillment
- Often consumable (software, physical goods)

### Coaching/Mastermind
- Recurring access to coaching
- Group component
- Time-bound (often 6-12 month commitments)

### Software (SaaS)
- Ongoing access to tool
- Usage-based or tier-based pricing
- See `Growth-Engines/Product-Led-Growth.md`

## 2. Continuity Funnel Structure

### Acquisition Flow
```
Traffic → Sales Page → Order Form → Onboarding → Member Area → Retention Loop
```

### Page 1: Sales Page
**Purpose:** Convert to initial subscription

**Elements:**
- Headline: Clear ongoing value
- What they get (content, access, community)
- How often (monthly deliverables)
- Price and billing (clear and transparent)
- Testimonials from current members
- Cancel-anytime policy (reduces friction)
- First-month or trial offer (if applicable)

### Page 2: Order Form
**Purpose:** Capture subscription

**Elements:**
- Clear price and billing frequency
- Payment options
- Trial terms (if applicable)
- Order bump (if applicable)
- Terms acceptance

### Page 3: Onboarding
**Purpose:** Activate new members quickly

**Critical:** The first 7-30 days determine retention
- Welcome sequence
- Quick win guidance
- Tour of key features/content
- Community introduction
- First milestone to hit

## 3. Acquisition Strategies

### Trial Models
| Type | Structure | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Free Trial** | $0 for X days, then full price | High-value, sticky products |
| **$1 Trial** | $1 for first month, then full price | Reduces tire-kickers |
| **Discounted First Month** | 50% off month 1 | Balance of friction and qualification |
| **No Trial** | Full price from start | Committed audiences, proven value |

### Discount Entry
- Launch pricing for founding members
- Annual prepay discount (improves cash flow, reduces churn)
- Bundle with one-time product

### Tier-Up Entry
- Offer membership as tier-up after one-time purchase
- "Want ongoing access? Add membership for $X/month"

## 4. Retention Framework

### Why Members Cancel
1. **No Immediate Value:** Never experienced quick win
2. **Overwhelm:** Too much content, unclear path
3. **Forgot:** Not engaged, don't remember benefit
4. **Outgrew:** Got what they needed
5. **Financial:** Can't afford / not worth cost
6. **Competition:** Found alternative

### Retention Strategies

**Onboarding (Days 1-30):**
- Welcome sequence with clear first action
- Quick win within first week
- Personal outreach (email, call, DM)
- Community introduction
- Usage tracking and re-engagement triggers

**Engagement (Ongoing):**
- Regular new content (predictable schedule)
- Live events and calls
- Community activity and connection
- Progress tracking and milestones
- Gamification (streaks, badges, levels)

**At-Risk Intervention:**
- Identify non-engagers early
- Win-back sequences
- Personal outreach for high-value members
- Exit surveys to understand reasons

## 5. Churn Reduction Tactics

### Involuntary Churn (Payment Failures)
- Dunning emails (payment failed notifications)
- Retry logic for failed payments
- Card update prompts before expiration
- Alternative payment options

### Voluntary Churn (Cancellations)
- Pause option instead of cancel
- Downgrade to lower tier
- Cancellation survey (learn why)
- Save offer (discount to stay)
- Reactivation sequence after cancel

### Metrics to Watch
- Monthly churn rate (% of members lost)
- Net revenue retention (expansion - churn)
- Time to first value (onboarding speed)
- Engagement metrics (login frequency, content consumption)

---

## 6. Pricing Strategy

### Monthly vs. Annual
- **Monthly:** Lower barrier, higher churn risk
- **Annual:** Higher commitment, better cash flow, lower churn
- **Offer both:** Annual at discount (typically 15-20%)

### Tiered Pricing
- Multiple levels (Basic, Pro, VIP)
- Clear differentiation between tiers
- Upgrade path built-in

### Pricing Principles
- Price for value delivered, not cost
- Annual option improves retention
- Founder pricing creates urgency at launch
- Price increases for new members signal growth

---

## 7. Content and Value Delivery

### Content Strategy
- Consistent delivery schedule
- Balance depth and breadth
- Clear content organization
- Regular "new" to justify subscription
- Archive/library for ongoing value

### Community Component
- Often the stickiest element
- Member-to-member value
- Facilitator presence
- Regular touchpoints

### Live Elements
- Monthly calls or Q&As
- Office hours
- Workshops or trainings
- Creates calendar commitment

---

## 8. Measurement Framework

### Acquisition Metrics
- Free-to-paid conversion (if trial)
- Trial-to-paid conversion
- Cost per member acquired
- Average order value (first transaction)

### Retention Metrics
- Monthly churn rate
- Annual churn rate
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Payback period (months to recover CAC)
- Net revenue retention

### Engagement Metrics
- Login frequency
- Content consumption
- Community participation
- Live event attendance
