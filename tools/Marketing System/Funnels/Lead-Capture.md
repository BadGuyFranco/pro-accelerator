# Lead Capture Funnels: Building Owned Audience

**Core Insight:** A lead capture funnel converts anonymous traffic into owned audience. The goal is a single, friction-free exchange: valuable content for contact information. Everything else (selling, nurturing, converting) happens after.


## Objective

To provide a framework for building lead capture funnels that maximize opt-in rates and set up effective nurture sequences.

## 1. The Lead Capture Purpose

### What It Does
- Converts traffic into email/SMS subscribers
- Starts the relationship with immediate value
- Qualifies prospects by interest area
- Feeds nurture sequences and future offers

### What It Doesn't Do
- Generate immediate revenue (that's tier-up or backend)
- Replace the need for nurturing
- Work without traffic

## 2. Core Structure

### Standard Opt-In Funnel
```
Traffic → Opt-In Page → Thank You Page → Onboarding Sequence
                              ↓
                    Lead Magnet Delivery
```

### Pages Required

**1. Opt-In Page**
- Headline: Clear promise of what they'll get
- Subheadline: Specific benefit or outcome
- Bullet points: What's included (optional)
- Form: Name + email (minimum fields)
- CTA button: Benefit-driven text

**2. Thank You Page**
- Confirm opt-in success
- Deliver or explain how to access lead magnet
- Set expectations for next emails
- Optional: Tier-up offer (low-ticket)

## 4. Quiz Funnels

Quiz funnels are lead capture plus segmentation in one.

### Structure
```
Quiz Landing Page → Quiz Questions → Results Page → Opt-In → Segmented Follow-Up
```

### Quiz Types
- **Assessment:** "What type of [X] are you?"
- **Diagnostic:** "What's your biggest [X] problem?"
- **Recommendation:** "Which [product/approach] is right for you?"

### Quiz Benefits
- Higher engagement than static opt-in
- Built-in segmentation data
- Personalized results increase value
- Higher opt-in rates (curiosity + personalization)

### Quiz Best Practices
- 5-10 questions maximum
- Progress indicator
- Results must be genuinely valuable
- Segmented follow-up based on results

---

## 5. Opt-In Page Optimization

### Headline Formulas
- "How to [Desired Outcome] Without [Pain Point]"
- "The [X]-Step [Framework] for [Result]"
- "Free [Resource]: [Specific Benefit]"
- "[Number] [Things] Every [Audience] Needs to [Outcome]"

### Conversion Elements
- **Specificity:** Concrete deliverable, not vague promise
- **Benefit-Driven:** What they get, not what it is
- **Visual:** Mockup of the lead magnet
- **Social Proof:** Subscriber count, testimonials (if available)
- **Minimal Friction:** Fewest fields possible

### What Hurts Conversions
- Vague headlines ("Get our newsletter")
- Too many form fields
- No visual representation of the offer
- Distracting navigation or links
- Slow page load

---

## 6. Thank You Page Strategy

### Basic Thank You
- Confirm success
- Explain delivery (check email, access link)
- Set expectations for future emails

### Tier-Up Thank You (Recommended)
After opt-in, offer a low-ticket product:
- "Before you go, I have something special..."
- Threshold offer ($7-$47)
- Relevant to lead magnet topic
- Helps offset ad costs

### Engagement Thank You
- Invite to community or social
- Suggest next piece of content
- Survey for additional segmentation

## 7. Traffic Matching

Match lead magnet to traffic temperature:

| Traffic | Lead Magnet Approach |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Cold (Ads)** | Broad appeal, quick win, curiosity-driven |
| **Warm (Content)** | Deeper dive, specific problem, personality visible |
| **Hot (Existing Audience)** | Exclusive, advanced, early access |

---

## 8. Post-Opt-In: The Handoff

Lead capture is not the goal; it's the beginning.

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Deliver the magnet:** Email or access page
2. **Welcome email:** Confirm, set expectations, personality
3. **Onboarding sequence:** Tension Thread (see `Sequences/Onboarding-Sequences.md`)
4. **Nurture cadence:** Ongoing relationship (see `Sequences/Nurture-Cadence.md`)

### Segmentation Opportunities
- Which lead magnet they opted into
- Quiz results
- Engagement with welcome sequence
- Traffic source

## 9. Measurement Framework

### Funnel Metrics
- **Opt-In Rate:** Visitors to subscribers
- **Cost Per Lead:** Ad spend / leads (if paid traffic)
- **Lead Magnet Delivery Rate:** Successfully delivered

### Quality Metrics
- **Email Engagement:** Opens, clicks on first emails
- **Conversion to Sale:** Leads who become customers
