# High-Ticket Funnels: Qualification and Conversation

**Core Insight:** High-ticket sales require human conversation. The funnel's job is to pre-qualify prospects, shift beliefs, and prepare them for a sales call. You're not selling the offer; you're selling the call. The call sells the offer.


## Objective

To provide a framework for building high-ticket funnels that attract qualified prospects, filter out poor fits, and prepare buyers for successful sales conversations.

## 1. High-Ticket Principles

### Why High-Ticket Is Different
- **Price requires conversation:** $3K+ typically needs human touch
- **Trust must be established:** Larger risk = more trust needed
- **Qualification matters:** Wrong clients cost more than no clients
- **Lifetime value is high:** Worth investing in the sale

### The Funnel's Job
1. Attract qualified prospects
2. Shift enough beliefs to book a call
3. Pre-qualify and filter out poor fits
4. Prepare prospect for a productive conversation
5. Make the sales call's job easier

## 2. Application Funnel Structure

### Complete Flow
```
Traffic → Application Page → Application Form → Thank You/Booking
                                                      ↓
              Pre-Call Nurture → Sales Call → Close → Onboarding
```

### Page 1: Application Page
**Purpose:** Sell the call, not the program

**Elements:**
- Headline: Clear outcome or transformation
- Video: VSL-style belief shifting (optional but recommended)
- Program overview (what it is, who it's for)
- Results and case studies
- Who this is for / not for (self-selection)
- CTA: "Apply Now"

### Page 2: Application Form
**Purpose:** Qualify and gather information for the call

**Question Categories:**
- Contact info (name, email, phone)
- Business/situation info
- Goals and desired outcomes
- Current challenges
- Timeline and urgency
- Budget/investment capacity (can be implicit)
- Commitment level

**Application Length:**
- Too short: No qualification
- Too long: Drop-offs
- Sweet spot: 8-15 questions

### Page 3: Thank You / Booking
**Purpose:** Schedule the call

**Options:**
- Direct calendar booking (Calendly, etc.)
- "We'll reach out to schedule" (for more control)
- Conditional booking (only if qualified)

---

## 3. Pre-Call Nurture

### Purpose
Prepare the prospect for a successful conversation:
- Reinforce beliefs shifted in application process
- Address common objections
- Build anticipation for the call
- Reduce no-show rate

### Pre-Call Content
**Immediately After Booking:**
- Confirmation email
- What to expect on the call
- How to prepare

**Between Booking and Call:**
- Case study or testimonial video
- FAQ addressing common objections
- Reminder emails (24h, 1h before)

**Optional: Pre-Call Homework**
- Questions to think about
- Video to watch
- Brief assessment to complete

## 4. Application Page Copy

### VSL Structure (Recommended)
Use a modified Conversion Theater:
1. Hook and big promise
2. Credibility and results
3. Who this is for
4. Brief methodology overview
5. Belief shifts (abbreviated)
6. Call to action: Apply

### Written Application Page
If no video:
- Compelling headline
- The problem they're facing
- Your unique approach
- Results and proof
- Who qualifies
- What happens when they apply
- Application CTA

### Key Messages
- This is selective (not everyone gets in)
- Results require commitment
- The call is valuable regardless of outcome
- This is for serious people ready to invest

---

## 5. Qualification Strategy

### Self-Qualification
Let prospects qualify themselves out:
- Clear "this is NOT for you if..." section
- Application questions that reveal fit
- Price range mention (if appropriate)

### Staff Qualification
Review applications before booking:
- Score based on key criteria
- Only schedule qualified calls
- Redirect non-qualifiers (nurture, different offer)

### Qualification Criteria
Define your ideal client:
- Problem awareness
- Financial capacity
- Decision-making ability
- Coachability/openness
- Timeline alignment

## 6. Sales Call Framework

### The Call's Job
- Build rapport and trust
- Diagnose the situation deeply
- Present the solution
- Handle objections
- Close or determine next steps

### Basic Structure
1. **Rapport (5 min):** Build connection
2. **Discovery (15-20 min):** Understand their situation
3. **Transition:** "Based on what you've told me..."
4. **Present (10-15 min):** The solution and how it works
5. **Objection Handling:** Address concerns
6. **Close:** Ask for the decision

### Key Principles
- Listen more than talk
- Ask questions, don't pitch
- Understand before prescribing
- Close is a natural conclusion, not pressure

---

## 7. Post-Call Follow-Up

### If They Buy
- Immediate confirmation
- Payment processing
- Onboarding sequence
- First touchpoint scheduled

### If They Don't Buy (Yet)
- Follow-up email thanking them for the call
- Address specific objections from call
- Share relevant case study
- Limited-time offer (if applicable)
- Add to long-term nurture

### If Not Qualified
- Graceful redirect
- Alternative offer (lower ticket)
- Add to nurture for future
- Referral request

---

## 8. Measurement Framework

### Funnel Metrics
- Application page conversion rate
- Application completion rate
- Booking rate (applications to calls)
- Show rate (booked to attended)

### Sales Metrics
- Close rate (calls to sales)
- Revenue per call
- Average deal size
- Time to close

### Quality Metrics
- Qualified application rate
- Client success rate
- Refund/cancellation rate
- Lifetime value

## 9. Common Mistakes

1. **Selling the program on the page:** The page sells the call
2. **No qualification:** Taking any call wastes time
3. **No pre-call nurture:** Prospects arrive cold
4. **Weak discovery:** Pitching before understanding
5. **High no-show rate:** Lack of commitment building
6. **No follow-up for non-buyers:** Lost opportunity
