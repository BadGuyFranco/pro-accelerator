# Core Principles

These principles apply to every marketing task.

## The Four Foundations

Marketing success requires four interlocking systems:

1. **Blueprint** - Know WHO you serve, WHERE they gather, what BAIT attracts them, and what RESULT you deliver
2. **Ascension** - Guide customers through increasing value and commitment
3. **Persuasion Structure** - Hook attention, shift beliefs through story, present clear offers
4. **Conviction Engineering** - Break false beliefs about Method, Self, and Circumstance

These are interdependent. A weak foundation in any area undermines the others.

## Foundation 1: Blueprint

Before any copy, funnel, or campaign, define:

### Who (Prime Prospect)

| Dimension | What to Define |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Demographics** | Age, location, job, income, education |
| **Psychographics** | Beliefs, fears, identity, motivations, internal narratives |
| **Core Desire** | Health, Wealth, or Relationships (all purchases map here) |
| **Sub-Desires** | Speed, certainty, simplicity, security, prestige, convenience, control |
| **Pain Points** | What they want to avoid or eliminate |
| **Obstacles** | What they believe prevents their outcome |

### Where (Congregations)

Your prime prospect already gathers in predictable places. You redirect existing attention; you don't create demand.

**Congregation Types:**
- Influencers, creators, thought leaders they follow
- Podcasts, channels, newsletters they consume
- Communities, forums, groups they participate in
- Tools, platforms, software they use
- Conferences, events, meetups they attend
- Keywords and search behaviors

**Action:** Build a list of 25-50 specific congregations.

### Bait (Entry Offer)

What compels the prime prospect to raise their hand and enter your world.

**Effective Bait:**
- Fast to consume, immediately valuable
- Solves a micro-specific problem
- High perceived value, low friction
- Sets up the core offer as the logical solution

### Result (Transformation)

People buy transformation, not products.

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Before State** | Chaos, confusion, frustration, overwhelm |
| **After State** | Clarity, achievement, control, progress, mastery |
| **Vehicle** | Your proprietary method, process, or system |
| **Proof** | Case studies, testimonials, track record, authority markers |

## Foundation 2: Ascension Architecture

Guide customers through a sequence of offers, each delivering greater transformation.

| Level | Purpose | Price Range |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Entry** | Get first "yes" with minimal barriers | Free |
| **Threshold** | Prove ability to help; qualify buyers | $7-$97 |
| **Core** | Deliver main transformation | $297-$2,997 |
| **High-Ticket** | Maximum support, speed, access | $5k-$100k |
| **Continuity** | Ongoing value, recurring revenue | $37-$297/month |

**Ascension Logic:**
- Each step solves a problem created by the previous step
- Delivers a meaningful win and reveals a new, larger desire
- Leads naturally to the next rung
- One core transformation across the entire ladder

## Foundation 3: Persuasion Structure (Capture-Connect-Convert)

The universal structure for every marketing asset.

| Component | Purpose | Key |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| **Hook (Capture)** | Stop the scroll, interrupt patterns | Wins attention; does NOT sell |
| **Story (Connect)** | Build connection, shift beliefs, create epiphany | Must change beliefs, not just entertain |
| **Offer (Convert)** | Present solution with clarity, value, urgency | Bridge from emotion to action |

**Sequence matters:** Without the Hook, no one listens. Without the Story, no one believes. Without the Offer, no one acts.

For hook frameworks, see `Persuasion/Hook-Architecture.md`.
For story frameworks, see `Persuasion/Story-Engineering.md`.
For offer frameworks, see `Persuasion/Offer-Design.md`.

## Foundation 4: Conviction Engineering

Every buying decision is governed by beliefs. Your marketing must break false beliefs and rebuild empowering ones.

### The Three Belief Barriers

| Barrier | What They Doubt | Conversion Goal |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Method** | "This approach won't work" | "This vehicle is the fastest path to my result" |
| **Self** | "I can't make it work" | "I can do this" |
| **Circumstance** | "External factors will stop me" | "My circumstances are not a barrier" |

### Breaking Beliefs

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Story** | Bypasses resistance through emotional experience |
| **Proof** | Demonstrations, case studies, testimonials |
| **Reframing** | Change the meaning ("Saturated = proven demand") |
| **Contradiction** | Show where the old belief is clearly untrue |
| **Analogy** | Simplify complex concepts with relatable comparison |

For full belief mechanics, see `Psychology/Belief-Mechanics.md`.

## Quick Reference

Before creating any marketing asset:

| Foundation | Key Question |
|------------|--------------|
| Blueprint | Who is this for, where do they gather, what bait draws them, what transformation do we deliver? |
| Ascension | Where does this offer sit on the ladder? What's the logical next step? |
| Persuasion | Does this asset have a clear Hook, Story, and Offer? |
| Conviction | What Method, Self, and Circumstance barriers must we break? |

## Measurement

For every marketing asset, define:

- **Leading indicator:** What signals success early? (CTR, engagement, opt-in rate)
- **Lagging indicator:** What confirms real success? (Conversion rate, revenue, CLV)
- **Test priority:** What single element would have the biggest impact?
