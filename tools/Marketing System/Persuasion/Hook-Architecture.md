# Hook Architecture

Frameworks for attention-capture elements: ads, headlines, email subject lines, video openings, content hooks.

## The Hook's Job

The Hook has ONE job: win attention and earn the right to deliver the Story.

**The Hook is NOT:** The pitch, the offer, the complete message

**The Hook IS:** A pattern interrupt, a curiosity generator, a relevance filter

**Success metric:** Did they stop, read/watch, and move to the next section?

## The Three Hook Elements

Every effective hook combines three elements:

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Specificity** | Concrete detail creates mental image | "47% increase" not "big improvement" |
| **Recognition** | Name what they feel but haven't articulated | "That moment when you launch and hear... nothing" |
| **Incompleteness** | Create tension that demands resolution | "The counterintuitive reason why..." |

Strongest hooks combine all three. Minimum: two of three.

## Hook Types

### 1. Curiosity Hooks

Promise valuable information without revealing it.

**Structures:**
- "The weird method I used to [outcome]"
- "What nobody tells you about [topic]"
- "The counterintuitive truth about [common belief]"
- "Why [common approach] is actually [unexpected result]"

**Best for:** Cold audiences, discovery content, paid ads

### 2. Call-Out Hooks

Identify the audience directly to filter for relevance.

**Structures:**
- "For [specific identity] who want [outcome]"
- "If you've ever [specific experience], this is for you"
- "[Identity]: This changes everything about [topic]"
- "Stop scrolling if you [specific situation]"

**Best for:** Targeted ads, niche content, warm audiences

### 3. Contrarian Hooks

Challenge a norm or common belief.

**Structures:**
- "Why [common advice] is wrong"
- "The case against [popular approach]"
- "[Controversial statement]. Here's why."
- "I stopped [common practice] and [unexpected result]"

**Best for:** Thought leadership, differentiation, sophisticated audiences

### 4. Outcome Hooks

Promise a clear, specific transformation.

**Structures:**
- "[Outcome] in [timeframe]"
- "How to [outcome] without [common obstacle]"
- "Get [specific result] using [method]"
- "From [before state] to [after state] in [timeframe]"

**Best for:** Ready-to-buy audiences, direct response, clear offers

### 5. Speed Hooks

Promise rapid results or quick consumption.

**Structures:**
- "In the next [short timeframe]..."
- "The [time period] fix for [problem]"
- "How I [outcome] in one [short period]"
- "[Number] minutes to [result]"

**Best for:** Busy audiences, low-friction offers, quick wins

### 6. Story Hooks

Open with a compelling narrative moment.

**Structures:**
- "I was [vivid moment] when [realization]"
- "It was [time/place] and [dramatic situation]"
- "The email said [specific words]"
- "I almost [dramatic action] until [turning point]"

**Best for:** Longer content, emails, video, building connection

### 7. Problem Hooks

Lead with the pain point directly.

**Structures:**
- "Tired of [frustrating situation]?"
- "If [problem] keeps happening, here's why"
- "The real reason [problem] won't go away"
- "[Problem] isn't your fault. It's [unexpected cause]."

**Best for:** Problem-aware audiences, solution-focused content

## Emotional Drivers

Every hook should activate one primary emotional driver:

| Driver | Trigger | Example Hook |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Frustration** | Something's broken | "Why your funnel isn't converting (and it's not your copy)" |
| **Ambition** | Edge they're missing | "What top 1% creators do differently" |
| **Curiosity** | Information gap | "The counterintuitive reason premium prices get more sales" |
| **Recognition** | Finally named | "That voice telling you you're not ready? Here's what it's hiding." |
| **Disgust** | Hypocrisy/waste | "Why most marketing advice keeps you buying courses" |
| **Fear** | Risk of loss | "The mistake that's costing you [amount] every month" |
| **Pride** | Validation | "If you've already tried everything, you're closer than you think" |

## Hook Formulas

### The [Number] [Outcome] Formula
- "[Number] ways to [desirable outcome]"
- "[Number] mistakes killing your [desired result]"

### The Question Formula
- "What if [desirable scenario]?"
- "Why do [successful people] always [specific action]?"

### The "How I" Formula
- "How I [outcome] in [timeframe] with [method/constraint]"
- "How I [outcome] without [expected requirement]"

### The Contrast Formula
- "[Before state] vs [After state]: The difference is [insight]"
- "Why [group A] succeeds while [group B] fails"

### The Challenge Formula
- "Stop [common action] (do this instead)"
- "Forget [conventional wisdom]. Here's what actually works."

## Format-Specific Guidance

### Ads (Meta, YouTube, etc.)
- First 1-3 words determine stop or scroll
- Visual and text must work together
- Hook must pre-frame the landing page
- Test 3-5 hook variations per ad set

### Email Subject Lines
- 4-7 words optimal for mobile
- Curiosity often outperforms clarity
- Test lowercase vs. title case

### Video Openings (First 3 Seconds)
- Visual pattern interrupt first
- Verbal hook immediately after
- Don't waste time on intros

### Headlines (Sales Pages, Articles)
- Specificity beats vagueness
- Outcome + mechanism + timeframe
- One clear promise, not multiple

## Hook Testing

### What to Test
1. Hook type (Curiosity vs. Outcome vs. Contrarian)
2. Emotional driver
3. Specificity level
4. Format (Question vs. statement)
5. Length (Short punch vs. longer setup)

### Success Metrics by Format

| Format | Primary Metric | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Ad | CTR | 1-3%+ |
| Email | Open rate | 20-40%+ |
| Video | Retention at 3 sec | 50%+ |

## Hook-to-Story Bridge

The hook earns attention. The bridge transitions to the story.

1. Hook delivers the pattern interrupt
2. Expansion delivers on the hook's implicit promise
3. Transition connects to your core message

First value delivery should happen within seconds of the hook.

## Audience Temperature

| Audience | Hook Strategy |
|----------|---------------|
| **Ready** (past buyers) | Direct, action-focused, skip mystery |
| **Familiar** (subscribers) | Story-based, belief-building hooks |
| **New** (cold traffic) | Maximum pattern interrupt, prove value fast |

Ready audiences want clarity. New audiences need curiosity first.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Does it pass the "wait, what?" test?
- [ ] Is it specific, not generic?
- [ ] Does it promise something the content delivers?
- [ ] Does it filter for the right audience?
- [ ] Does it lead naturally to the story/content?
