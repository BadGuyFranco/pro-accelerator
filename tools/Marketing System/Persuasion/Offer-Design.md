# Offer Design

Frameworks for creating offers, pricing, value stacks, bonuses, guarantees.

## The Offer's Job

The offer bridges emotion and action. After the story creates desire, the offer channels that desire into a specific decision.

**Key principle:** An irresistible offer is not about lowering price. It's about increasing perceived value so dramatically that the price feels tiny by comparison.

```
Perceived Value >> Price = Irresistible
```

## The Nine Offer Components

| # | Component | Purpose |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Core Offer | The main vehicle/transformation |
| 2 | Deliverables | What they tangibly receive |
| 3 | Bonuses | Value amplifiers that remove objections |
| 4 | Value Stack | Visual demonstration of total value |
| 5 | Scarcity | Limited availability |
| 6 | Urgency | Time pressure |
| 7 | Guarantee | Risk reversal |
| 8 | Price Anchor | Comparison that makes price feel small |
| 9 | CTA | Clear next action |

## Component 1: Core Offer

The heart of your offer; the main transformation you're selling.

### Core Offer Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Specific problem** | Solves one clear, high-value problem |
| **Clear transformation** | Delivers a defined outcome |
| **Proven process** | Follows a methodology, not random tactics |
| **Fresh pathway** | Positioned as new approach |
| **Vehicle focus** | Sells the vehicle, not the labor |

### Core Offer Formula

```
[Outcome] in [Timeframe] using [Method]
(without [Common Obstacle])
(even if [Common Excuse])
```

## Component 2: Deliverables

What they tangibly receive when they buy.

**Effective Deliverables Are:**
- Concrete and visualizable
- Outcome-aligned
- Fast to consume
- High perceived value

**Name as outcomes, not features:**
- "Module 3: Traffic" → "The Traffic Engine: 5 Streams of Qualified Leads"
- "Coaching Call" → "Personalized Strategy Session"
- "Templates" → "Done-For-You Launch Kit"

## Component 3: Bonuses

Bonuses amplify perceived value and remove implementation barriers.

**The Bonus Rule:** Every bonus should be directly tied to an objection.

| Objection | Bonus Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| "I don't have time" | "Fast-Start Templates" |
| "I'm not technical" | "Done-For-You Tech Setup Guide" |
| "What if it doesn't work for me?" | "Case Study Vault with 50 Industries" |

**Bonus Categories:** Speed, Ease, Confidence, Support, Tools

**Principles:**
- Bonuses should feel like they could be sold separately
- Each bonus gets its own value assignment
- Limit to 3-5 bonuses

## Component 4: Value Stack

The visual/numerical demonstration of what's included.

### Value Stack Psychology
- Segmentation increases perceived value
- Individual values create mental anchors
- Total value dwarfs price

### Value Stack Example
```
What You Get:
- 8-Week Program ($1,997 value)
- Template Pack ($297 value)
- Weekly Coaching Calls ($997 value)
- Private Community ($297 value)
- BONUS: Fast-Start Kit ($197 value)
- BONUS: Swipe File Vault ($297 value)

Total Value: $4,082
Your Investment Today: $497
```

Values must be defensible. Outrageous inflation destroys trust.

## Component 5: Scarcity

Limited availability increases perceived value.

| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Quantity** | "Only 50 spots" | Cohort programs |
| **Capacity** | "I can only take 10 clients" | Services, coaching |
| **Access** | "Only during this launch" | Launches |

**Rules:**
- Scarcity must be TRUE and REAL
- Explain WHY it's scarce
- Show evidence (counter, waitlist)

## Component 6: Urgency

Time pressure drives immediate action.

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Cart close** | "Doors close Friday at midnight" |
| **Price increase** | "Price goes up tomorrow" |
| **Bonus expiration** | "Fast-action bonus disappears in 24 hours" |
| **Cohort start** | "Class begins Monday" |

**Rules:** Tie to real deadlines. Follow through.

## Component 7: Guarantee

Guarantees shift risk from buyer to seller.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Unconditional** | "30-day money-back guarantee" |
| **Conditional** | "Complete the program and if you don't get [result], full refund" |
| **Performance** | "If you don't add 10 clients in 90 days, double your money back" |
| **Extended trial** | "Use it for 60 days before you decide" |

Stronger guarantees increase conversions. Refund rates rarely increase proportionally. Name your guarantee.

## Component 8: Price Anchor

Anchoring reframes the price by comparison.

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Stacked value** | "Total value: $4,000. Your price: $497." |
| **Alternative cost** | "A consultant charges $5k/month..." |
| **Cost of inaction** | "Every month without this costs you $2k..." |
| **Per-day breakdown** | "That's less than $3/day..." |

## Component 9: CTA

Tell them exactly what to do next.

**CTA Requirements:** Simple, Direct, Urgent, Benefit-driven

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Learn more" | "Start your transformation now" |
| "Submit" | "Get instant access" |
| "Buy now" | "Claim your spot before doors close" |

**Placement:** Above the fold, after each major section, after testimonials, after guarantee, final CTA after full pitch.

## The Stack and Close Sequence

For presentations (webinar, VSL, sales page):

1. Recap transformation
2. Introduce offer
3. Present deliverables with values
4. Present bonuses with values
5. Show total stacked value
6. Reveal price (with anchor)
7. Add guarantee
8. Add scarcity
9. Add urgency
10. CTA
11. Handle objections
12. CTA again
13. Testimonials
14. CTA again

## Offer Design by Ladder Position

| Position | Offer Strategy | Key Elements |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Lead Magnet** | High value, zero friction | Immediate delivery, quick win |
| **Threshold** | Prove you can help | Low price, high value ratio |
| **Core** | Full transformation | Complete solution, main vehicle |
| **High-Ticket** | Maximum support/speed | Done-with/for-you, access |
| **Continuity** | Ongoing value | Community, regular delivery |

## Offer Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Issue | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| High interest, no purchase | Price/value mismatch | Increase value stack or reduce friction |
| No interest | Wrong audience or weak hook | Fix targeting or hook |
| Cart abandonment | Risk too high | Strengthen guarantee |
| "Not now" | Insufficient urgency | Add real deadline |
| "Not for me" | Belief barriers unaddressed | Fix story/belief shift |

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Is the core transformation clear and desirable?
- [ ] Is the vehicle believable?
- [ ] Are deliverables tangible and named as outcomes?
- [ ] Do bonuses address real objections?
- [ ] Is value stack specific and defensible?
- [ ] Is scarcity real and explained?
- [ ] Is urgency tied to real deadline?
- [ ] Is guarantee strong and named?
- [ ] Is price anchored effectively?
- [ ] Is CTA clear and repeated?

## Measurement

| Metric | What It Indicates |
|--------|-------------------|
| Conversion rate | Overall offer effectiveness |
| Add-to-cart rate | Interest vs. friction |
| Cart abandonment | Risk or objection issues |
| Tier-up acceptance | Value communication |
| Refund rate | Promise vs. delivery match |
