# Paid Acquisition: Traffic You Control

**Core Insight:** Paid traffic is the ignition source for scalable growth. When dialed in, it provides predictable, scalable customer acquisition. The goal is simple: buy a customer for less than they're worth, or break even on the front end to acquire leads for free.


## Objective

To provide a principle-based framework for paid acquisition that works across platforms, enabling predictable scaling while maintaining profitability. This file covers strategy, not platform-specific tactics.

## 1. The Paid Acquisition Equation

**Core Formula:**

```
Profit = (Revenue per Customer) - (Cost to Acquire Customer)
```

**Two Viable Strategies:**

1. **Profitable Acquisition:** Buy customers for less than they're worth (immediate profit).
2. **Break-Even Acquisition:** Acquire leads/buyers at zero cost, profit on backend (funded front-end).

**Critical Metrics:**
- **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):** What you pay to acquire a customer
- **AOV (Average Order Value):** What customers spend on first purchase
- **CLV (Customer Lifetime Value):** Total revenue from a customer over time
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend):** Revenue generated per dollar spent

**The Unlock:** When front-end ROAS >= 1.0, you can scale infinitely. Every dollar in returns a dollar (or more) out.

## 2. The Three Traffic Temperatures

Match your paid strategy to audience temperature (see `Psychology/Attention-Mechanics.md`):

### New Audience (Cold)
- **Characteristics:** No awareness, no trust, high skepticism
- **Strategy:** Lead with curiosity, story, and pattern interrupts
- **Offer Type:** Free or low-friction (lead magnet, threshold offer)
- **Funnel Type:** Opt-in, Author Pipeline, Break-Even Gateway
- **Creative Focus:** Big hooks, emotional resonance, fresh pathway framing

### Familiar Audience (Warm)
- **Characteristics:** Knows you, partial trust, needs belief-building
- **Strategy:** Teach, share stories, break false beliefs
- **Offer Type:** Mid-ticket, core offers
- **Funnel Type:** Webinars, VSLs, Challenges
- **Creative Focus:** Story-driven, proof-heavy, belief transformation

### Ready Audience (Hot)
- **Characteristics:** High trust, high intent, ready to buy
- **Strategy:** Direct, offer-focused, action-oriented
- **Offer Type:** High-ticket, backend, ascension offers
- **Funnel Type:** Direct-to-offer, applications
- **Creative Focus:** Results, urgency, clear next steps

**Critical Mistake:** Running cold traffic to high-ticket offers without warming. Temperature mismatch kills campaigns.

## 3. The Creative Testing Framework

Creative (hook + visual + copy) determines 80% of paid campaign success. Testing is not optional.

### The Creative Hierarchy

1. **Hook/Angle:** The core idea or approach (test first, highest impact)
2. **Format:** Video vs. image vs. carousel vs. text
3. **Visual:** Imagery, colors, faces, b-roll, graphics
4. **Copy Structure:** Long vs. short, story vs. direct, testimonial vs. personal
5. **CTA:** Button text, urgency language

### Testing Protocol

1. **Start with Hook Diversity:** Test 3-5 completely different hooks/angles
2. **Identify Winners:** Let data reveal which angles resonate
3. **Iterate on Winners:** Create variations of winning hooks
4. **Format Expansion:** Test winning hooks across formats
5. **Scale Winners:** Increase budget on proven creatives

**Principle:** Test broad first (angles), then deep (variations of winners).

### Creative Fatigue

Paid creatives decay. Plan for ongoing testing:
- **High Spend:** New creatives weekly
- **Medium Spend:** New creatives bi-weekly
- **Low Spend:** New creatives monthly

## 4. Context Primers for Paid Traffic

Cold traffic often needs pre-framing before entering the funnel (see v1 Context-Primers).

### When to Use Primers
- High-ticket offers to cold audiences
- Complex or unfamiliar vehicles
- Skeptical markets
- When direct-to-funnel CTR is low

### Primer Types
1. **Advertorial/Bridge Pages:** Long-form content between ad and funnel
2. **Video Pre-Sell:** Short video that builds curiosity and belief
3. **Quiz Funnels:** Self-identification creates relevance
4. **Case Study Ads:** Lead with proof, then offer

### Primer Structure
1. Pattern interrupt
2. Big promise or insight
3. Story or example
4. Belief shift
5. Soft CTA into funnel

**Measurement:** Track CTR from ad to primer, and primer to funnel. Optimize both.

## 5. Platform-Agnostic Principles

Platforms change constantly. These principles remain stable:

### Audience Selection
- **Interest/Behavior Targeting:** Reach people based on interests, behaviors, demographics
- **Lookalike/Similar Audiences:** Find people similar to your best customers
- **Retargeting:** Re-engage people who've already interacted
- **Custom Audiences:** Upload your owned lists (email, phone)

**Principle:** Start broad, let algorithms learn, then refine based on results.

### Budget Allocation
- **Testing Budget:** Dedicated spend for creative/audience testing (typically 20-30%)
- **Scaling Budget:** Spend on proven winners
- **Rule of Thumb:** Don't scale until you have 3+ days of profitable data

### Bidding Strategy
- **Learning Phase:** Give campaigns enough budget and time to optimize
- **Conversion Optimization:** Optimize for the deepest action you have volume for
- **Manual vs. Auto:** Start with auto bidding; manual for advanced optimization

## 6. The Paid Acquisition Flywheel

Paid acquisition becomes more powerful when integrated with other growth engines:

```
Paid Traffic → Funnel → Owned Traffic (Email/SMS)
                ↓
        Nurture Sequence → Conversion
                ↓
    Customer → Backend Offers → Higher CLV
                ↓
      Retargeting → Lower CPA on Next Campaign
                ↓
       Testimonials/Case Studies → Better Creatives
```

**Principle:** Every customer acquired through paid should increase the efficiency of future paid campaigns through:
- Better retargeting audiences
- Higher CLV (funds more ad spend)
- Social proof for creatives
- Referrals that lower overall CAC

## 7. Troubleshooting Paid Campaigns

### Low CTR (Click-Through Rate)
- **Cause:** Hook isn't compelling, wrong audience, creative fatigue
- **Fix:** Test new hooks, tighten targeting, refresh creatives

### High CTR but Low Conversion
- **Cause:** Message mismatch between ad and landing page
- **Fix:** Ensure ad pre-frames landing page; align messaging

### High CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
- **Cause:** Weak offer, wrong audience temperature, funnel friction
- **Fix:** Strengthen offer, warm audience with primers, optimize funnel

### Inconsistent Results
- **Cause:** Small sample sizes, algorithm learning, creative fatigue
- **Fix:** Increase budget for statistical significance, refresh creatives

## 8. Measurement Framework

### Leading Indicators (Early Signals)
- CTR (Click-Through Rate): Is the hook working?
- CPC (Cost Per Click): How expensive is attention?
- Landing Page Conversion Rate: Is the page working?

### Lagging Indicators (Business Impact)
- CPA (Cost Per Acquisition): Full cost to acquire a customer
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend): Revenue per dollar spent
- CLV:CAC Ratio: Long-term health (aim for 3:1+)

### Testing Velocity
- Track: Number of creatives tested per week
- Track: Win rate on new creatives
- Track: Time from test to scale

## 9. Integration with Other Growth Engines

Paid acquisition works best in combination:

- **+ Creator Collaborations:** Run paid amplification on influencer content
- **+ Content-Led Growth:** Retarget organic content consumers
- **+ Community-Led Growth:** Paid ads to community signup
- **+ Referral Systems:** Fund referral rewards with paid acquisition efficiency

**Principle:** Paid is the accelerant, not the only fuel. Use it to amplify what's already working organically.
