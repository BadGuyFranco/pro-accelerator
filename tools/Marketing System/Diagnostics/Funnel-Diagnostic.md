# Funnel Diagnostic

**Purpose:** Systematically identify where a funnel is underperforming and what to fix.

## Quick Assessment

### Step 1: Where Is It Breaking?

Map your funnel metrics against benchmarks:

| Stage | Your Metric | Benchmark | Status |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Traffic → Opt-in** | ___% | 20-40% (warm), 2-5% (cold) | |
| **Opt-in → Engaged** | ___% | 25-40% open rate | |
| **Engaged → Attended** | ___% | 25-40% show rate | |
| **Attended → Purchased** | ___% | 5-15% conversion | |
| **Purchased → Completed** | ___% | 80%+ (cohort), 15%+ (self-paced) | |
| **Completed → Referred** | ___% | Track | |

**Find the biggest gap from benchmark.** That's your constraint.

## Stage-by-Stage Diagnosis

### Traffic Problems
**Symptom:** Not enough people entering the funnel

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Wrong audience** | High bounce, low engagement | Refine targeting, messaging |
| **Weak creative** | Low CTR | Test new hooks, angles, formats |
| **Channel exhaustion** | Rising CPAs | Diversify channels, refresh audiences |
| **No traffic strategy** | Inconsistent volume | Build growth engine (see `Growth-Engines/`) |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Where is traffic coming from?
- Is it the right audience (match to Prime Prospect)?
- What's the cost per click/view?

---

### Opt-in Problems
**Symptom:** Traffic not converting to leads

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Weak lead magnet** | Low opt-in rate | More specific, valuable, relevant offer |
| **Poor headline** | High bounce, low time-on-page | Test new headlines (see `Persuasion/Hook-Architecture.md`) |
| **Too much friction** | Form abandonment | Reduce fields, clarify value |
| **Traffic-offer mismatch** | Low relevance | Align ad message to landing page |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Does the lead magnet solve an urgent problem?
- Is the headline specific and benefit-driven?
- Is the form asking for too much?

---

### Engagement Problems
**Symptom:** Leads not opening/clicking/engaging

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Weak subject lines** | Low open rate | Test curiosity, personalization, specificity |
| **Low-value content** | Opens but no clicks | Improve content value, storytelling |
| **Wrong frequency** | Unsubscribes, complaints | Adjust cadence (see `Sequences/Nurture-Cadence.md`) |
| **Deliverability issues** | Declining opens | Clean list, warm domain, improve engagement |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Are subject lines earning the open?
- Is content delivering value or just pitching?
- Are emails landing in inbox or spam?

---

### Show Rate Problems (Webinars/Presentations)
**Symptom:** Registrations not showing up

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Weak anticipation** | Low show rate | Better reminder sequence, pre-event content |
| **Wrong timing** | Show rate drops at certain times | Test different days/times |
| **No commitment** | Easy signup, no follow-through | Add calendar integration, SMS reminders |
| **Value unclear** | Registrants don't see urgency | Clarify what they'll learn/get |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Are we building anticipation before the event?
- Is the timing convenient for the audience?
- Did they add it to their calendar?

---

### Conversion Problems
**Symptom:** Engaged audience not buying

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Offer-audience mismatch** | Low conversion, high bounce | Refine offer or audience targeting |
| **Belief barriers remain** | Objections in feedback | Address Method/Self/Circumstance (see `Psychology/Belief-Mechanics.md`) |
| **Weak offer** | Low desire, price sensitivity | Improve value stack (see `Persuasion/Offer-Design.md`) |
| **No urgency** | "I'll do it later" | Add real scarcity, deadline |
| **Friction in checkout** | Cart abandonment | Simplify, add trust signals, payment options |

**Questions to Ask:**
- What objections are people raising?
- Is the offer clearly valuable at the price?
- Is there a reason to buy now?

---

### Fulfillment/Completion Problems
**Symptom:** Buyers not using/finishing product

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Poor onboarding** | Quick drop-off | First-win guidance, welcome sequence |
| **Overwhelm** | Low engagement after start | Simplify, clear path, chunk content |
| **No accountability** | Drift and abandon | Cohort model, community, check-ins |
| **Wrong buyers** | High refunds, low completion | Improve qualification, set expectations |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Do they get a quick win in the first session?
- Is there a clear path to completion?
- Is there community/accountability built in?

---

### Retention/Referral Problems
**Symptom:** Buyers not staying or referring

| Issue | Signal | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **Didn't get results** | Churn, no testimonials | Improve delivery, support |
| **No request for referral** | Low referrals | Ask! Create referral system |
| **No ongoing value** | Membership churn | Content calendar, engagement events |
| **No community** | Isolation, churn | Build community, peer connections |

**Questions to Ask:**
- Did they achieve the promised transformation?
- Have we asked for referrals/testimonials?
- Is there a reason to stay engaged?

## The Constraint Theory

**Principle:** Your funnel is only as strong as its weakest link.

1. **Identify the constraint:** Which stage is furthest below benchmark?
2. **Fix the constraint:** Focus ALL optimization energy here
3. **Re-measure:** Did fixing it shift the constraint elsewhere?
4. **Repeat:** Find and fix the new constraint

**Common Mistake:** Optimizing traffic when conversion is the problem. More traffic to a broken funnel wastes money.

## Quick Fixes by Stage

| Stage | Quick Test |
|-------|------------|
| **Traffic** | Test new audience or creative |
| **Opt-in** | Test new headline or lead magnet |
| **Engagement** | Test new subject lines or content angle |
| **Show Rate** | Add SMS reminder or pre-event content |
| **Conversion** | Test new headline, price, or urgency |
| **Completion** | Add first-win guidance |
| **Retention** | Add community or ongoing value |

---

## When to Rebuild vs. Optimize

**Optimize** when:
- Metrics are close to benchmark
- Single stage is weak
- Core offer is validated

**Rebuild** when:
- Most stages underperform
- Offer never converted well
- Market has shifted
