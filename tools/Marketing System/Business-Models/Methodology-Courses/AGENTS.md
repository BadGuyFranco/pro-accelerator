# Courses and Methodology Framework [NOVEL]


## Purpose

Generate complete go-to-market systems for methodology-based educational products targeting skeptical B2B professionals. Outputs include demand validation assets, sales infrastructure, delivery structure, and awareness strategies.

## When to Use This Framework

Load this framework when the user wants to:
- Build a website for a proprietary methodology, framework, or system
- Create a certification or licensure program for expertise-based products
- Develop course funnels for professional audiences (not consumer/beginner markets)
- Generate complete marketing content for a methodology they've already defined

**Keywords that trigger this framework:** methodology course, certification site, course website, framework launch, licensure program, B2B course, professional certification

## Prerequisites

Before executing this framework, you MUST have access to:

### 1. The Methodology Documentation

Complete documentation of the framework being taught:
- Core concepts, principles, and structure
- Terminology and naming conventions
- The "units" of the methodology (protocols, canvases, playbooks, modules, etc.)

**Example sources:** Method documentation, foundations documents, training materials

### 2. The Positioning Documentation

How this methodology is marketed to its target audience:
- Target audience definition
- Core messaging and value propositions
- Competitive positioning
- Brand voice and tone

**Example sources:** Marketing master documents, positioning guides, brand guidelines

**If either prerequisite is missing:** Stop and request the missing documentation before proceeding.

## Framework Files

| File | Purpose | When to Load |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **AGENTS.md** (this file) | Workflow and routing | Always read first |
| **Master-Blueprint.md** | Complete framework system (3 business phases + Phase 0) | Load for full execution |
| **Output-Templates.md** | Exact formats for all deliverables | Load during content generation |

## The Three-Phase Model

This framework organizes work by **business milestones**, not content types:

| Phase | Goal | What You Build | Lifecycle |
|-------|------|----------------|-----------|
| **Phase 0** | Establish credibility | Proof-of-work content, community presence | Prerequisite (may be complete) |
| **Phase 1** | Validate demand | Waitlist, early emails, awareness | Done once done |
| **Phase 2** | Convert to sales | Site, quiz, kit, emails, sales page, awareness | Ongoing (iterate per cohort) |
| **Phase 3** | Deliver and compound | Cohort, certification, testimonials, awareness | Ongoing (improve per cohort) |

**Why this matters:**
- Phase 1 validates demand before investing in full sales infrastructure
- Phase 2/3 are ongoing; expect iteration with each cohort
- Awareness is integrated into every phase, not bolted on afterward

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Analysis

**Objective:** Internalize the methodology and positioning to inform all downstream content.

**Actions:**
1. Read and analyze the methodology documentation
2. Read and analyze the positioning documentation
3. Extract and define the placeholder values:

| Placeholder | Definition | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| `[METHODOLOGY]` | Framework name | "WISER Method" |
| `[CORE UNIT]` | Primary deliverable unit | "Protocol," "Canvas," "Playbook" |
| `[CREDENTIAL]` | Certification/licensure term | "Licensed Practitioner," "Certified Facilitator" |
| `[DIAGNOSTIC]` | Assessment tool name | "Readiness Assessment," "Maturity Audit" |
| `[DOMAIN]` | Professional domain | "AI practice," "product strategy" |
| `[AUDIENCE]` | Target professional | "AI practitioners," "product leaders" |

**Output:** Analysis summary with all placeholders defined and key insights noted.

### Step 2: Phase 0 Assessment

**Objective:** Determine if Phase 0 (Proof-of-Work) is complete or needed.

**Actions:**
1. Check if methodology creator has established credibility:
   - 1,000+ email subscribers (organic growth)
   - 50+ pieces of public content demonstrating expertise
   - Recognition in target communities
   - 10+ unsolicited inquiries about learning more
2. If Phase 0 is incomplete, generate Phase 0 content plan with awareness strategy
3. If Phase 0 is complete, proceed to Phase 1

**Output:** Phase 0 status assessment; if needed, Phase 0 content plan.

### Step 3: Phase 1 Content (Early Interest)

**Objective:** Generate assets to validate demand before building full infrastructure.

**Actions:**
1. Load `Output-Templates.md` for exact deliverable formats
2. Generate Phase 1 content:
   - Waitlist landing page copy
   - Waitlist email sequences (welcome, anticipation, doors opening)
   - Phase 1 awareness strategy (personal outreach, LinkedIn content, community)
3. Optionally: Adapt diagnostic quiz for waitlist capture (CTAs point to waitlist, not sales)

**Output:** Complete Phase 1 content ready for implementation.

### Step 4: Phase 2 Content (Open for Sales)

**Objective:** Generate complete sales infrastructure.

**Actions:**
1. Generate site architecture content:
   - Homepage copy
   - Library page (public [CORE UNITS])
   - Documentation page
   - Sales page for [CREDENTIAL] program
2. Generate diagnostic funnel (quiz questions, scoring, results)
3. Generate Implementation Kit (components and copy)
4. Generate email sequences (nurture, onboarding, cart, launch)
5. Generate Phase 2 awareness strategy (referrals, launch promotion, social proof)

**Output:** Complete Phase 2 content per Output Templates specifications.

### Step 5: Phase 3 Content (Delivery)

**Objective:** Generate cohort structure and ongoing awareness flywheel.

**Actions:**
1. Generate cohort curriculum (weekly structure, requirements, credential criteria)
2. Generate beta/founding cohort protocol (if applicable)
3. Generate Phase 3 awareness strategy (testimonials, case studies, practitioner network)

**Output:** Complete Phase 3 content per Output Templates specifications.

### Step 6: Implementation System

**Objective:** Create actionable implementation structure.

**Actions:**
1. Generate Implementation Todo organized by phase:
   - Phase 1: Early Interest (minimal viable launch)
   - Phase 2: Open for Sales (full infrastructure)
   - Phase 3: Delivery (run cohort)
2. Identify dependencies between tasks
3. Flag decisions that require human input
4. Generate System Summary (overview document)
5. Generate Output AGENTS.md (meta-instructions for managing the system)

**Output:** Complete implementation system with todo, summary, and agent instructions.

## File Numbering Convention

Organize output files by phase using decade-based numbering:

```
00-02  Meta/Planning (system summary, todo, analysis)
1X     Phase 1 content (Early Interest / Waitlist)
2X     Phase 2 content (Open for Sales)
3X     Phase 3 content (Delivery)
```

This enables:
- Clear organization by business phase
- Easy identification of which phase a file serves
- Room for new files within each phase

## Phase Lifecycle Management

**Critical:** Phases have different lifecycles.

| Phase | Lifecycle | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Done once done | After waitlist validates demand and sales open, Phase 1 is complete. Content rarely changes. |
| **Phase 2** | Ongoing | Sales infrastructure evolves. Each cohort launch may refine messaging, pricing, tactics. |
| **Phase 3** | Ongoing | Delivery improves with each cohort. Awareness compounds (testimonials, referrals). |

When modifying generated content:
- **Phase 1 files:** Confirm with user before modifying ("Phase 1 is typically complete. Are you reopening it?")
- **Phase 2/3 files:** Expected to evolve; update based on learnings

## Integration with Marketing System 2

This framework builds on Marketing System 2 foundations:

| MS2 Framework | How It's Used Here |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `Core/Core-Principles.md` | Capture-Connect-Convert applies to all copy |
| `Psychology/Value-Exchange.md` | Ascension Architecture informs the Commitment Ladder |
| `Funnels/Low-Ticket.md` | Threshold Offer patterns apply with B2B adjustments |
| `Sequences/Onboarding-Sequences.md` | Tension Thread patterns inform email architecture |
| `Funnels/Continuity.md` | Membership patterns inform cohort structure |
| `Growth-Engines/Content-Led-Growth.md` | Awareness strategies throughout |
| `Platforms/Newsletter.md` | Email as media property |

Load parent framework files when generating specific content types that need deeper guidance.

## Quality Checks

Before delivering outputs:

- [ ] All placeholder values consistently applied throughout
- [ ] Content reflects methodology's actual structure and terminology
- [ ] Positioning and voice match the positioning documentation
- [ ] All three phases addressed (or explicitly noted as out of scope)
- [ ] Each phase includes awareness strategy
- [ ] Todo list is actionable without requiring framework knowledge
- [ ] Output AGENTS.md included for system management
- [ ] File numbering follows decade-based convention
- [ ] No guru marketing tactics (income claims, countdown timers, hype language)

## Common Failure Modes

**Generating generic content:** Output must reflect the specific methodology, not placeholder-filled templates. Every piece should feel custom.

**Skipping Phase 1:** Without demand validation, you risk building infrastructure nobody wants. Phase 1 is minimal investment to test demand.

**Ignoring awareness:** Traffic is often the hardest part. Each phase needs awareness tactics, not just content assets.

**Misaligning voice:** B2B professional audiences require different tone than consumer courses. Match the positioning documentation's voice exactly.

**Treating all phases as build tasks:** Phase 1 is done-once-done. Phases 2/3 iterate. Generate content accordingly.

**Overwhelming todo lists:** Group related tasks by phase, identify the critical path, and make clear what can be parallelized vs. what has dependencies.
