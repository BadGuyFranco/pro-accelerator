# SaaS: Software as a Service Marketing

Marketing framework for software businesses.

**Core Insight:** SaaS marketing differs from info-products. The product can demonstrate value before purchase. Trial and freemium models allow the product to sell itself. The goal shifts from convincing to activating, from selling to expanding.

## SaaS Growth Models

### Sales-Led Growth
- **Motion:** Marketing generates leads → Sales closes deals
- **Best For:** Enterprise, high ACV ($10K+), complex products
- **Funnel:** Content → Lead magnet → Demo request → Sales call → Close

### Product-Led Growth (PLG)
- **Motion:** Users try product → Experience value → Self-serve upgrade
- **Best For:** SMB, lower ACV, self-serve capable products
- **Funnel:** Discovery → Signup → Activation → Upgrade

### Hybrid (Product-Led Sales)
- **Motion:** PLG for entry → Sales for expansion/enterprise
- **Best For:** Multi-segment targeting, land-and-expand
- **Funnel:** Free/trial → Self-serve → Usage signals → Sales outreach

## The SaaS Customer Journey

### Acquisition
**PLG:** Discovery → Signup (Free/Trial) → Onboarding
**Sales-Led:** Content → Lead Capture → Nurture → Demo → Proposal → Close

### Activation
Getting users to experience core value.
- Time to first value
- Activation rate (% reaching "aha" moment)
- Feature adoption rates

### Conversion
**Self-Serve:** Upgrade prompts, usage limits, feature gates
**Sales-Assisted:** PQL identification, sales outreach, demos

### Expansion
- Seat expansion (more users)
- Usage expansion (more volume)
- Tier upgrades (higher plans)
- Cross-sell (additional products)

### Retention
See `Funnels/Continuity.md` for retention frameworks.

## SaaS Funnel Patterns

### Demo Funnel (Sales-Led)
```
Content/Ads → Landing Page → Demo Request → Qualification → Demo → Proposal → Close
```

### Trial Funnel (PLG)
```
Discovery → Signup → Onboarding → Activation → Upgrade Prompt → Conversion
```

### Freemium Funnel (PLG)
```
Discovery → Free Signup → Usage → Upgrade Trigger → Self-Serve Upgrade
```

## Email Marketing for SaaS

### Lifecycle Sequences
**Trial Onboarding:** Welcome → Feature highlights → Success stories → Upgrade prompts → Trial expiring

**Free User Nurture:** Value delivery → Feature education → Success stories → Upgrade triggers

**Customer Onboarding:** Welcome → Quick wins → Feature adoption → Success milestones → Expansion

### Trigger-Based Emails
- Usage milestones reached
- Feature adoption prompts
- Inactivity warnings
- Upgrade triggers
- Renewal reminders

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Models
| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **Per Seat** | Collaboration tools |
| **Usage-Based** | Infrastructure, APIs |
| **Tiered** | Diverse customer needs |
| **Flat Rate** | Simple products |

### Free vs. Trial
| Factor | Free Tier | Trial |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Conversion pressure | Low | High (time limit) |
| Activation focus | Critical | Important |
| Revenue timing | Delayed | Faster |

## Metrics

### Acquisition
- CAC: Cost to acquire a customer
- Payback Period: Months to recover CAC

### Activation
