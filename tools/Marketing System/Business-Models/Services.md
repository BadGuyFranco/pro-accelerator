# Services: High-Touch Marketing for Expertise

Marketing framework for consulting, agency, and done-for-you businesses.

**Core Insight:** Service businesses sell expertise and outcomes, not products. Trust is the primary conversion factor. The goal is positioning as the obvious choice before the sales conversation begins.

## What Makes Services Different

- **Intangible:** Can't see or try before buying
- **High Trust Required:** Buying expertise and judgment
- **Relationship-Driven:** Personal connection matters
- **Custom Delivery:** Each engagement is unique
- **Capacity Constrained:** Can't scale like products

## Service Growth Models

### Inbound Authority Model
Build authority → Attract inquiries → Qualify → Close
**Best For:** Consultants, experts, specialized services

### Outbound Prospecting Model
Identify targets → Reach out → Start conversation → Close
**Best For:** B2B agencies, defined target market

### Referral-Driven Model
Deliver excellent work → Clients refer → Qualify → Close
**Best For:** Established businesses, premium positioning

### Productized Service Model
Package expertise → Market like a product → Deliver systematically
**Best For:** Scalable, repeatable services
