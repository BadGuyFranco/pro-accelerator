# Nurture Cadence: Ongoing Relationship Building

**Core Insight:** After onboarding, subscribers need consistent nurture to maintain connection and buying readiness. The Casual Cadence turns everyday moments into belief-building stories, keeping you top-of-mind and making every future offer easier to sell.


## Objective

To provide a sustainable, ongoing email approach that maintains subscriber engagement, deepens relationship, builds beliefs, and drives consistent traffic to offers.

## 1. The Nurture Philosophy

### Shift in Mindset
| Wrong Approach | Right Approach |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Email when I have something to sell" | "Email consistently, sell naturally" |
| "Teach my best content" | "Tell stories that teach subtly" |
| "Be professional" | "Be personal and human" |
| "Wait for the perfect message" | "Send consistently, imperfect is fine" |

### Why Consistency Wins
- **Frequency builds trust:** Regular contact signals reliability
- **Repetition builds belief:** Core ideas reinforced daily
- **Entertainment increases consumption:** Fun emails get opened
- **Conversation beats content:** Relationship > information

## 2. The Casual Cadence Structure

Every effective nurture email follows this 3-part structure:

### Part 1: Start with a Story
Use ANY everyday situation:
- Something funny that happened
- A mistake you made
- A random encounter
- Something from childhood
- Something your kids/pets did
- Something embarrassing, annoying, or surprising
- A moment of struggle or gratitude

**Story Rules:**
- Keep it short
- Keep it real
- Keep it emotional
- Start fast; skip long buildup
- First sentence must hook

**Opening Line Examples:**
- "I nearly burned down my kitchen yesterday."
- "You're not going to believe what I found in my mailbox..."
- "I made the dumbest mistake last night."

### Part 2: Tie to a Lesson or Belief
Extract a principle and connect it to your niche:
- Kitchen disaster → importance of having a system
- Missing a flight → urgency in business
- Awkward interaction → fear holding people back
- Kid story → how habits form early
- Gym moment → consistency beats intensity

**Purpose:** This is the subtle belief-shifting portion. You're reinforcing the worldview that makes your offer the obvious solution.

### Part 3: Transition to a CTA
Every email should end with a clickable action:
- Link to your main funnel
- Invite to a webinar
- Promote a threshold offer
- Send to a YouTube video or podcast
- Ask them to reply
- Nudge toward core offer

**CTA Principles:**
- Keep it simple
- Make it feel like a natural extension of the story
- One CTA per email

## 3. Content Mix and Frameworks

### The 80/20 Mix
- **80% Value:** Stories, insights, entertainment (no direct sell)
- **20% Promotional:** Direct offers, launches, CTAs

### Email Frameworks for Variety

**The Story-Lesson Email (Standard)**
Story → Lesson → CTA

**The Polarity Email**
Take a strong stance on something (industry myth, bad advice, contrarian view).
Purpose: Attract right audience, repel wrong.

**The Open Loop Email**
Start a story and don't finish it.
Purpose: Drive opens on next email.

**The Confession Email**
Share a flaw or mistake.
Purpose: Build trust through vulnerability.

**The Behind-the-Scenes Email**
Show what you're working on.
Purpose: Create intimacy through transparency.

**The Call-Out Email**
Speak directly to your prime prospect's identity.
Purpose: Deepen emotional resonance.

## 4. Frequency Options

### Daily (High-Touch)
- **Pros:** Maximum relationship depth, highest recall
- **Cons:** Demanding to maintain, higher unsubscribes from wrong fit
- **Best For:** Personality-driven brands, high-engagement niches

### 2-3x Weekly (Medium-Touch)
- **Pros:** Sustainable, maintains connection
- **Cons:** Less relationship depth than daily
- **Best For:** Most businesses, balanced approach

### Weekly (Minimum Viable)
- **Pros:** Easy to maintain, works for busy teams
- **Cons:** Loses urgency and recall
- **Best For:** Supplementary channel (not primary nurture)

**Principle:** Whatever frequency you choose, consistency matters more than frequency.

## 5. Writing Style

### Tone and Voice
- Write like you talk
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Conversational, not corporate
- Personal, not professional
- Curious, not preachy

### Subject Lines
- Curiosity-driven
- Personal/intriguing
- Conversational

**Examples:**
- "I almost made a huge mistake"
- "This was embarrassing..."
- "Can I be honest with you?"
- "The weirdest thing happened yesterday"

### Email Length
- Short enough to read quickly
- Long enough to tell the story
- Typically 200-400 words
