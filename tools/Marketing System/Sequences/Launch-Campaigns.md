# Launch Campaigns: Orchestrated Sales Events

**Core Insight:** Launches create concentrated buying energy through a structured sequence of anticipation, education, and urgency. A well-executed launch generates more revenue in a week than months of passive selling, while building audience excitement and belief.


## Objective

To provide a comprehensive framework for launching products, courses, or programs through orchestrated multi-touch campaigns that build anticipation, shift beliefs, and drive conversion through strategic urgency.

## 1. The Launch Psychology

### Why Launches Work
- **Scarcity:** Limited time creates urgency
- **Social Proof:** Seeing others buy creates momentum
- **Anticipation:** Pre-launch builds desire before doors open
- **Event Energy:** Concentrated attention amplifies response
- **Deadline:** Cart close forces decision

### The Launch Paradox
People procrastinate on decisions until forced. A launch creates the forcing function that passive selling lacks.

## 2. Launch Models

### Live Launch (Time-Bound)
- **Structure:** Fixed dates, real deadlines, live elements
- **Advantages:** Maximum urgency, live interaction, social proof
- **Challenges:** Resource-intensive, all-or-nothing
- **Best For:** Major product releases, premium programs

### Evergreen Launch (Automated)
- **Structure:** Triggered by opt-in, simulated urgency
- **Advantages:** Runs continuously, scalable
- **Challenges:** Lower conversion than live, ethical urgency required
- **Best For:** Funnels running on autopilot

### Hybrid Launch
- **Structure:** Live launch recorded, replayed with real deadlines
- **Advantages:** Combines live energy with scalability
- **Best For:** Scaling proven live launches

## 3. Live Launch Structure

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (1-4 Weeks Before)
**Goal:** Build anticipation, grow list, warm audience

**Activities:**
- Announce something is coming (without full details)
- Create waitlist or early-access signup
- Drop hints and teasers
- Build curiosity and desire
- Grow email list specifically for launch

**Content:**
- "Something big is coming" posts
- Behind-the-scenes glimpses
- Pre-launch content that teaches adjacent topics
- Warm-up emails to existing list

### Phase 2: Pre-Launch Content (PLC) Sequence
**Goal:** Educate, shift beliefs, build desire before cart opens

**Structure (Classic 3-4 PLC Model):**

**PLC 1: The Opportunity**
- What's possible for them
- The transformation available
- Why now is the right time
- End with open loop for PLC 2

**PLC 2: The Transformation (Your Vehicle)**
- How the transformation happens
- Your unique method/approach
- Break Method barriers
- Social proof and case studies
- End with open loop for PLC 3

**PLC 3: The Ownership Experience**
- What it feels like to have the result
- Break Self and Circumstance barriers
- More social proof
- Prepare for cart open

**Optional PLC 4: Q&A / Objection Handling**
- Address remaining doubts
- Final belief shifts before cart open

**Format Options:**
- Video (most common)
- Written (longer attention spans)
- Live webinar per PLC
- Challenge format (daily PLCs)

### Phase 3: Open Cart (3-7 Days)
**Goal:** Convert interest into sales

**Structure:**

**Day 1: Cart Open**
- Announce doors are open
- Full sales page available
- Early-bird bonus or incentive
- Clear CTA to buy

**Days 2-4: Engagement and Proof**
- Case studies and testimonials
- FAQ answers
- Live Q&A (optional)
- Objection-handling content
- Behind-the-scenes

**Day 5-6: Urgency Building**
- Bonuses expiring
- Spots filling
- Countdown to close
- Final testimonials

**Day 7: Cart Close**
- Final emails (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Real deadline, real consequences
- Last chance messaging

### Phase 4: Post-Launch
- Thank buyers, deliver value immediately
- For non-buyers: "Doors closed" email, what's next
- Debrief and document learnings
- Plan next launch or transition to evergreen

---

## 4. Launch Email Sequence

### Pre-Launch Emails
- Waitlist confirmation and expectation-setting
- PLC release announcements
- Reminder emails for each PLC
- Engagement prompts

### Cart Open Sequence (Example for 7-Day Open Cart)

| Day | Email Focus |
|-----|-------------|
| 1 AM | Cart is open + early bonus |
| 1 PM | What's included (overview) |
| 2 | Case study / testimonial |
| 3 | FAQ / objection handling |
| 4 | Behind-the-scenes / your story |
| 5 | Bonus expiring warning |
| 6 AM | 24-hour warning |
| 6 PM | Tonight at midnight |
| 7 AM | Last day |
| 7 Noon | Final hours |
| 7 PM | Last chance (doors closing) |
| 7 Late | Doors closed |

---

## 5. Belief Transformation in Launches

Each phase targets specific beliefs (see `Psychology/Belief-Mechanics.md`):

| Phase | Primary Belief Focus |
|-------|---------------------|
| Pre-Launch | "I need to pay attention to this" |
| PLC 1 | "This transformation is possible" |
| PLC 2 | "This vehicle/method works" (Method barrier) |
| PLC 3 | "I can do this" (Self + Circumstance barriers) |
| Cart Open | "This is worth the investment, and now is the time" |

## 6. Scarcity and Urgency (Ethical)

### Legitimate Scarcity
- Limited spots (capacity-based)
- Limited time (enrollment windows)
- Limited bonuses (truly expiring)
- Cohort-based (starts on a date)

### Urgency Amplifiers
- Cart close deadline
- Price increase after launch
- Bonus removal
- Fast-action incentives

### Ethical Principle
Scarcity and urgency must be REAL. Fake countdown timers and manufactured limits destroy trust and violate regulations.

---

## 7. Evergreen Launch Adaptations

### Trigger: Opt-in to Funnel
- Webinar registration starts the sequence
- Challenge signup triggers countdown
- Lead magnet starts automated launch

### Urgency Mechanisms (Ethical Evergreen)
- Deadline based on opt-in date ("Your offer expires in 7 days")
- Limited-time bonus (genuinely time-bound per user)
- Cohort starts (next cohort enrollment)
- Price anchored to specific window

### Considerations
- Lower conversion than live (no social proof momentum)
- Requires robust automation
- Test against live launch performance

---

## 8. Launch Metrics

### Pre-Launch Metrics
- Waitlist signups
- PLC views and completion rates
- Email engagement (opens, clicks)
- Social engagement

### Cart-Open Metrics
- Sales page visits
- Conversion rate (visitors to buyers)
- Revenue
- Average order value
- Refund rate (post-launch)

### Post-Launch Analysis
- Revenue vs. goal
- List growth during launch
- Conversion rate by traffic source
- Email sequence performance
- What worked, what didn't

## 9. Common Launch Mistakes

1. **Launching to a cold list:** No pre-launch warming
2. **Weak PLC content:** Not enough belief transformation
3. **Too long or too short cart open:** Sweet spot is 5-7 days
4. **Not enough emails on close day:** Decision happens at deadline
5. **Fake scarcity:** Destroys trust permanently
6. **No post-launch plan:** Losing momentum and non-buyers
7. **Over-launching:** Audience fatigue from too many launches

## Quality Checks for Launches

Before launching:

- [ ] Pre-launch audience warmed and waitlist built
- [ ] PLC content addresses all three belief barriers
- [ ] Sales page complete with full offer stack
- [ ] Email sequence written and loaded
- [ ] Scarcity/urgency is real and documented
- [ ] Tech tested (payment, delivery, automation)
- [ ] Post-launch plan ready (buyer onboarding, non-buyer follow-up)
- [ ] Success metrics defined
