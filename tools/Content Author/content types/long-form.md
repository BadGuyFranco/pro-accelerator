# Format: Long Form (500+ words)

## Purpose & Scope

Substantial practitioner content: articles, essays, guides, frameworks, thought leadership. Content that transforms understanding through depth, synthesis, and comprehensive development of ideas.

## Target Specifications

**Length:** 500-5,000+ words (scales with complexity)
**Platform:** Blogs, publications, documentation, standalone pieces
**Audience context:** Readers choosing to invest significant time for deep understanding
**Success metric:** Reader's understanding or approach fundamentally changes

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- Must have clear narrative arc (not just topic coverage)
- Categories must show dependency logic (A enables B enables C)
- Requires synthesis opportunities (multiple concepts working together)
- Opening must hook attention (use SPARK Framework when appropriate)

**Voice application notes:**
- Full application of voice.md principles without compromise
- Depth allows for transparent certainty (showing reasoning and boundaries)
- Length permits grounding technical terms properly before use
- Space for contrarian angles and unexpected details

**Formatting standards:**
- Use markdown headers for category separation (#, ##, ###)
- Never use hard-coded numbering (I, II, III or 1, 2, 3)
- Separate sections with headers or whitespace
- Bold only for key terms, not entire sentences

## Workflow

### Pre-Work: Clarify Scope

Determine:
- Original idea or extraction from source material?
- Target length (500, 1000, 2000, 3000+ words)?
- Opening approach (SPARK-driven hook or context-appropriate alternative)?
  - If using SPARK: Load content types/spark.md for complete framework
  - If skipping SPARK: Ensure format-appropriate alternative (claim-first, direct, etc.)

### Step 1: Concept Development

**Purpose:** Build a complete concept worth the reader's time investment

**Execute:**
- Identify core claim or insight (the one thing readers must understand)
- Test for novelty (fresh angle or new synthesis)
- Find the tension (problem, misconception, or opportunity being addressed)
- Map 3-5 supporting angles that develop the core claim

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Builder's stance (practical, not theoretical)
- Honest confidence (show reasoning, acknowledge boundaries)

**Output:** Concept brief (core claim + why it matters + supporting angles + target length)

### Step 2: Category Structure

**Purpose:** Create narrative flow that guides readers from insight to insight

**Execute:**
- Identify natural groupings from supporting angles
- Order with dependency logic (foundational → dependent)
- Apply Category Quality Principles:
  - Journey completeness (end-to-end progression, not isolated points)
  - Positive framing (achievement over avoidance where possible)
  - Dimensional coverage (complementary perspectives)
  - Universal applicability (avoid edge cases as primary structure)
  - Mutual reinforcement (constructive overlap, not confusion)
- Name categories descriptively (signal what reader will learn/do)
- Write 2 sentences per category: why it matters, how it connects, what reader gains

**Cognitive Layering (for progressive content):**

For content where sections build understanding scaffolds (curriculum, case studies with phases, instructional sequences), structure so each section builds a mental model that subsequent sections require:

- Name the mental model each section builds (internal planning, not visible to readers)
- Verify each section's mental model requires only what came before
- Add brief cognitive bridges at transitions when the dependency isn't obvious

Example progression in a five-phase case study:
- Section 1: "We don't know what we think we know"
- Section 2: "Testing assumptions cheaply beats building confidently" (requires accepting ignorance)
- Section 3: "Working software reveals what specs hide" (requires valuing cheap tests)

Skip for: single-section articles, reference docs, intentionally modular content.

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Results focus (every category leads somewhere)
- Honor simplicity (natural clustering, not forced templates)

**Output:** Ordered categories with descriptive names + 2-sentence definitions + connection notes

**Scaling guidance:**
- 500-800 words: 3-4 categories
- 1,000-2,000 words: 5-7 categories
- 2,000-3,000 words: 6-8 categories
- 3,000+ words: 8-12 categories (may need sub-categories)

### Step 3: Specificity Pass

**Purpose:** Gather concrete ammunition that makes abstract ideas tangible

**Execute:**
- For each category, identify 2-3 specific details:
  - Concrete examples (real, named, not hypothetical)
  - Unexpected details (facts that make points memorable)
  - Contrarian angles (challenges to conventional wisdom)
  - Numbers and data (specific metrics)
  - Counterintuitive elements (surprises that shift thinking)
  - Sensory/emotional anchors (what this looks/feels like in practice)
- Note which technical terms need grounding before use
- Mark which details come from source material vs constructed

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Authenticity constraints (never fabricate examples)
- Fight abstraction (ground claims in observable reality)

**Output:** 2-3 specific details per category + technical term grounding plan + source attribution

**Scaling guidance:**
- 500-800 words: 1 detail per category minimum
- 1,000+ words: 2-3 details per category

### Step 4: Full Draft

**Purpose:** Write complete first draft incorporating structure, specificity, and voice

**Execute:**
- Write LONGER than target (you'll cut back in step 5)
  - 500-word target → write to 700
  - 1,000-word target → write to 1,400
  - 2,000-word target → write to 2,800
  - 3,000-word target → write to 4,200
- Open with SPARK (see content types/spark.md if using) or claim-first approach
- Write each category incorporating specific details from step 3
- Apply Bridge Check AS YOU WRITE (insert "because"/"which means"/"therefore" between sentences - if it doesn't fit naturally, rewrite)
- Apply Deletion Check AS YOU WRITE (ask "what breaks if I delete this?" - if nothing, cut it)
- Vary sentence length and paragraph structure
- End with doable next step OR invitation to think differently (no summary)

**Apply from voice.md:**
- All core principles (builder's stance, honest confidence, results focus)
- All signature moves (in-the-room presence, transparent certainty, rhythm and flow)
- Zero prohibited elements (no hedging, jargon, formulaic transitions, passive voice)

**Output:** Complete first draft (longer than target, in voice, structure intact)

### Step 5: Comprehensive Edit

**Purpose:** Single pass addressing logic, voice, claims, structure, elevation simultaneously

**Execute:**
- Run all preflight checks:
  - Clean prose (cut hedging, meta-commentary, throat-clearing, unjustified words)
  - Grounded claims (show how you know, flag inference, name boundaries)
  - Natural flow (bridge check passes, reads smoothly aloud, sections connect)
  - Fresh execution (no repetitive patterns, feels specific to THIS topic)
  - Voice consistency (person usage consistent, no prohibited elements)
  - Human voice (sounds like real person, not algorithm)
- Cut back to target length:
  - Remove sentences failing deletion check
  - Consolidate redundant explanations
  - Trim elaborations on clear points
  - Keep bridge sentences that connect ideas
  - Keep specific details that ground abstractions
- Check logic and claims (no unsupported assertions, no hallucinations, boundaries clear)
- Verify structure still serves content

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Transparent certainty (boundaries shown, not hedged)
- Honor simplicity (cut over-engineering)

**Output:** Refined second draft (at target length, logic sound, voice consistent)

### Step 6: Final Polish

**Purpose:** Catch over-optimization, ensure human voice

**Execute:**
- Check for too-perfect syndrome (every sentence identical rhythm, nothing spontaneous)
- Verify rhythm variation (mix of short/medium/longer sentences)
- Test voice at boundaries (opening/closing/transitions sound conversational)
- Final scan for residual corporate speak or abstract nouns
- Make minimal changes only (2-3 strategic breaks of rules if they strengthen specific moments)

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Rules are defaults, not chains (break them when it strengthens the work)
- Authenticity constraints remain non-negotiable

**Output:** Final content ready to publish

## Quality Gates

**Mandatory checks (from AGENTS.md):**
- [ ] Bridge check passes (every sentence earns the next through causal connection)
- [ ] Deletion check passes (every sentence justified by substance or flow)
- [ ] No prohibited elements present (no hedging, jargon, formulaic transitions, passive voice)
- [ ] Authenticity constraints honored (no fabricated examples)

**Format-specific checks:**
- [ ] Narrative arc evident (not just topic coverage)
- [ ] Categories show dependency logic (progressive sequence)
- [ ] Opening hooks attention appropriately
- [ ] Specific details ground abstract claims
- [ ] Closing provides action or new thinking (no summary)
- [ ] Length appropriate to complexity
- [ ] Technical terms grounded before use

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- Invest in depth where complexity warrants it
- Use headers to create visual hierarchy and navigation
- Ground technical concepts before using them freely
- Show your reasoning and boundaries (transparent certainty)
- Let high-impact ideas influence structure naturally

**Don't:**
- Force equal distribution when importance clusters
- Summarize at the end what you already said
- Use hard-coded section numbering
- Start with context instead of claim
- Add examples to what's already clear

## Common Failure Modes

**Kitchen sink ordering:** Including every angle without clear through-line. Cut what doesn't serve the core concept. Test: Can you explain why each category is essential?

**Skeletal writing:** Writing so concisely you lose connective tissue. Write full, then trim. Brevity comes from cu
