# [Workspace Name] - AI Agent Instructions

[One-sentence description of what this workspace is for]

## Workspace Structure

This workspace has multiple root directories:

- **`/cofounder/`** - Shared tools and libraries (read instructions from here)
- **`/[Workspace Name]/`** - Active workspace (your working directory)

**Important:** `/cofounder/` contains the shared tool library. See `/cofounder/AGENTS.md` for tool routing and `/cofounder/README.md` for an overview.

## Available Tools

For the full list of available tools and when to use them, see `/cofounder/AGENTS.md`.

Common tools you may need:
- **Content Author** - Writing content (load `/cofounder/tools/Content Author/AGENTS.md`)
- **Image Generator** - Creating images (load `/cofounder/tools/Image Generator/AGENTS.md`)
- **Visualizer** - Creating diagrams (load `/cofounder/tools/Visualizer/AGENTS.md`)

**Single Source of Truth:** Tool instructions live in `/cofounder/`. Do not duplicate them here. Reference and load them when needed.

## Workspace Rules

**Read/Write:**
- `/[Workspace Name]/` - All content creation and modifications happen here

**Read-Only (unless explicitly instructed):**
- `/cofounder/` - Shared library; do not modify

2. **[Step 2]** - [What to do]
3. **[Step 3]** - [Where to save output]
4. **[Validation]** - [How to verify quality]

### [Secondary Workflow] (if applicable)

[Additional workflows as needed]

## What This Workspace Creates

- [Output type 1]
- [Output type 2]
- [Output type 3]

## Quality Standards

Every deliverable must:
1. [Standard 1]

3. [Workspace-specific first step]
4. [Next step]


## Template Instructions (DELETE WHEN DONE)

**When customizing this template:**

1. Replace all `[placeholders]` with workspace-specific content
2. Define your Primary Constraint clearly
3. Document actual workflows you'll use
4. Update "What This Workspace Creates" with real outputs
5. Remove sections that don't apply

**Single Source of Truth reminder:**
- Tool instructions live in `/cofounder/tools/[Tool]/AGENTS.md`
- Reference them, don't duplicate them
- This file defines workspace context, not tool behavior

**Directory usage:**
- `clients/` - Organize by client name
- `internal/` - SOPs, processes, team documentation
- `marketing/content/` - Blog posts, articles, thought leadership
- `marketing/assets/` - Logos, images, brand materials
- `marketing/research/` - Competitive analysis, market research
- `git/scripts/` - Workspace automation (not general tools)
- `git/templates/` - Proposals, contracts, reusable documents
- `zArchive/` - Move old versions here instead of deleting

**Delete this section when done.**
