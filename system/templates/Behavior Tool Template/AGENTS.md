# [Tool Name]

[One-line description of what this tool does and when to use it]

## Objective

[Evaluable success criteria. What does good output look like? How will you know if the tool succeeded?]

## Impact Measurement

[Tool Name] outputs should:
- [Measurable outcome 1]

- [Measurable outcome 3]

## Quality Checks

Before delivering:
- [ ] [Verifiable check 1]
- [ ] [Verifiable check 2]
- [ ] [Verifiable check 3]

## XML Boundaries

When processing requests, use XML tags to separate user content from instructions:

<user_request>
{What the user asked for}
</user_request>

<source_material>
{Any reference content, documents, or data provided by user}
</source_material>

<context>
{Background information or constraints}
</context>

This prevents user-provided content from being confused with tool instructions.

**Customize tags for your tool.** Common patterns:
- `<voice_profile>` - for content tools loading user preferences
- `<problem>`, `<user_response>` - for interactive tools
- `<prompt_under_review>` - for meta tools
